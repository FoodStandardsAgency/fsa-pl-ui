            <p>The survey found one in four has suffered a reaction while eating out in a restaurant or cafe since
                new
                allergen labelling legislation came in a year ago. It also found that nearly one in five (19%) of
                those
                allergic reactions resulted in a hospital visit.
            </p>
            <p>The EU Food Information for Consumers (FIC) legislation came into force in December 2014, and means
                that
                food businesses have to make information on 14 allergens available to consumers. This ranges from
                the
                most common allergens, such as peanuts and gluten, to less well known triggers for allergic
                reactions
                such as mustard and celery. Around 2 million people in the UK suffer from allergies, including 2% of
                adults and 8% of children.
            </p>
            <p>The survey, which was carried out to mark Allergy Awareness Week 2016, found that overall 83% of
                respondents reported noticing an increase in measures designed to make life easier for allergic
                consumers – including menus marking out allergens, and staff actively checking food information with
                the
                kitchen. More than half (58%) of allergic consumers said that their overall experience of eating out
                has
                improved; just 6% said it has got worse. As a result, a similar proportion (52%) say they now feel
                more
                confident eating out than they did before the legislation was introduced.
            </p>
            <p>However, people with allergies still report a number of problems when eating out. More than
                two-thirds
                (69%) have experienced staff not understanding the severity of an allergy, and how easily a mistake
                can
                cause a reaction. A similar number (68%) have seen staff with a lack of knowledge of what’s on the
                menu
                or in the food – including staff confusing eggs with dairy, or assuming that the customer was asking
                for
                gluten-free rather than avoiding lupin (a grain commonly used in place of wheat). Over half of
                allergic
                consumers (56%) said they have been made to feel like an inconvenience due to their allergy.
            </p>
            <p>In total, around a third of those with a food allergy have suffered a reaction in the last year when
                eating out of the home. The vast majority of these (25%) took place in a restaurant or cafe, with 9%
                being a result of takeaway food. In most cases (88%) the reaction was self-treated, with 19% of
                reactions resulting in a hospital visit.

            <p>Dr Chun-Han Chan, Food Allergy Expert at the FSA, commented: 'It’s been more than a year since the
                introduction of this legislation and we’re pleased to see real progress in how food businesses
                provide
                information on allergens to their customers. In general, the situation is improving for the two
                million
                food allergic consumers in the UK, and greater numbers have the confidence to eat out.
            </p>
            <p>'However, our survey has found that this isn’t true for everyone, and that many establishments aren’t
                yet
                providing the information that their customers need. The number of people suffering from food
                allergies
                and intolerances has increased in the last decade, so it’s clear that it is not something businesses
                can
                ignore. Allergies can be fatal, and this is why it is vital food businesses give their customers
                information they can trust.'
            </p>
            <p>If anyone encounters a food business not providing information on the 14 allergens, they should
                report it
                to its local authority which will investigate. The survey showed that those affected are currently
                more
                likely to report it to staff in the first instance (69%) or complain on social media after the event
                (23%).
            </p>
            <p>Food businesses have been given flexibility on how they provide allergy information. This can be
                communicated verbally through explanations by staff or signposted to where or how more information
                can
                be found on menus or in additional leaflets.

                <p>Food allergies and intolerances are life changing. In the UK they affect around 8% of
                    children and 2% of adults. In December 2014, the law on how allergen information is provided
                    by food businesses changed, to make it easier when buying food or eating out with an allergy
                    or intolerance.</p>
