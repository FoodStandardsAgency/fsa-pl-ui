                        out
                        has improved; just 6% said it has got worse. As a result, a similar proportion (52%) say
                        they now feel more confident eating out than they did before the legislation was
                        introduced.</p>

                        mistake

                        or in the food – including staff confusing eggs with dairy, or assuming that the
                        customer
                        was asking
                        for
