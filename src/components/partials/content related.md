                <p>Food allergies and intolerances are life changing. In the UK they affect around 8% of
                    children and 2% of adults. In December 2014, the law on how allergen information is provided
                    by food businesses changed, to make it easier when buying food or eating out with an allergy
                    or intolerance.</p>

                    for businesses</a>
                <p>This guidance helps food businesses provide information to customers who need to avoid
                    certain ingredients because of a food allergy or intolerance. It includes allergen
                    information rules (EU FIC), general advice and information on food allergy and intolerance,
                    and specific voluntary best practice guidance on cross-contamination controls for pre-packed
                    foods and loose foods.</p>
