            <p>The survey found one in four has suffered a reaction while eating out in a restaurant or cafe since
                new
                allergen labelling legislation came in a year ago. It also found that nearly one in five (19%) of
                those
                allergic reactions resulted in a hospital visit.

            <p>The EU Food Information for Consumers (FIC) legislation came into force in December 2014, and means
                that
                food businesses have to make information on 14 allergens available to consumers. This ranges from
                the
                most common allergens, such as peanuts and gluten, to less well known triggers for allergic
                reactions
                such as mustard and celery. Around 2 million people in the UK suffer from allergies, including 2% of
                adults and 8% of children.
